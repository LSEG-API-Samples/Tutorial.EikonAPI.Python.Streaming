Tutorial notebooks explaining how to retrieve streaming data with the Eikon Data API

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
This project contains Jupyter Notebook examples that demonstrate how to use the Eikon Data API to retrieve streaming real-time data. These Jupyter Notebooks show you how to use the Eikon Data API for the following use case:

* [Using the Eikon Data API as a real-time cache](https://github.com/Refinitiv-API-Samples/Tutorial.EikonAPI.Python.Streaming/blob/master/01%20-%20Eikon%20Data%20API%20-%20StreamingPrices%20as%20a%20cache.ipynb)
* [Using the Eikon Data API to receive streaming events](https://github.com/Refinitiv-API-Samples/Tutorial.EikonAPI.Python.Streaming/blob/master/02%20-%20Eikon%20Data%20API%20-%20StreamingPrices%20with%20events.ipynb)

These notebooks are part of the [How to retrieve real-time streaming data](https://developers.refinitiv.com/content/how-retrieve-real-time-streaming-data) Eikon Data API tutorial that is one of the many learning materials published on the [Refinitv Developer Community](https://developers.refinitiv.com) to help developers learning Refinitiv APIs.
